## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am continually amazed by how long it takes me to accomplish the goals set forth by the challenges. I learn quickly and retain what I learn, but to get the CSS to do what I want it to do is a constantly evolving process. I am always going back and rewriting the CSS to look "pretty". I get the challenges done in the end. Is this normal? Will I get faster just by doing things over and over?

### Continued development

I like how I set up the colors and typography, and plan to continue doing them this way because it leaves me free to write the rest of the CSS to size and place elements.
